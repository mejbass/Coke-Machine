# Coke-Machine
This GitHub repository contains a Python program, `coke.py`, that simulates a Coke vending machine, prompting users to insert coins until at least 50 cents is reached and then providing the calculated change owed. The project is part of CS50's Python curriculum, and testing instructions are included for verification.
